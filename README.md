# jstpp
JavaScript Text Preprocessor

A general-purpose text preprocessor written in JavaScript. Inspired by the [C preprocessor](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/index.html#Top).
Both preprocessors have similar uses and capabilities.
But jstpp is more powerful in that it is intended to be used to preprocess any text, not just text files that represent C source code.
Also, jstpp [macros](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html) are just JavaScript. This means that what the C preprocessor calls *function-like macros* are JavaScript functions.
Conversely, *object-like macros* are just javascript values.

Codename `jstpp`. Candidate final names:
* JavaScript Text Preprocessor
* JSTPP
* JustaPP
* justa-pp
* justa-p
* justap
